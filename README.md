## My Cursor Guide

Disable cursor audio effects
----------------------------

When I first use cursor, I almost think someone hacked my computer...

In Cursor, press Command+Shift+P and search for Help: List Signal sounds.
You can disable the sounds there.

I only keep the audio effects when I receive model's response.

Do not use latest version of Cursor.
-----------------------------------

Even though I appreciate Cursor's fast iteration speed, the lastest version is not stable at all. 
Rather I speed 2 hours explain how to fix `ssh` issue, the easiest walkaround is to use `0.45` version.
